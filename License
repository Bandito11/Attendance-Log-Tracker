This code for this app, Attendance Log Tracker, cannot be copied or downloaded as is in order to be distributed in any Store for Applications or a Web platform. This app is used for learning or reviewing. 

Snippets of code can be copied and used as the user sees fit but you can't download the code from the repository as is in order to distribute it as a personal product.

If me, Esteban Morales, finds that the app was copied as is and distributed anywhere (Play Store, App Store, Microsoft Store or any Web Platform) I will take it that this code was stolen and will act according to the law of the United States.
